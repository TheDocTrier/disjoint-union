A "formless commission" is a **donation**.<sup>[why?](#why-this-document)</sup>

From the perspective of the artist, everything else in this document is merely **a suggestion, not an obligation**.
This document will refer to the artist as "you" since artists are the most important readers here.

## The Donor

If you have a list of commission options with associated prices, the donor must choose one of the provided options.
**The donor must donate an amount at least as much as the price of the commission option chosen.**
The donor should not haggle with you for a lower price.
If the price is too much, then the donor should just make a simple donation, not a formless commission.
The purpose of a formless commission is to recognize your services while also providing you with unilateral freedom to create what you wish.
It is not to diminish your self-worth.

## For You, The Artist

You should make an effort to treat the formless commission like your regular commissions.
Notably:

* If you have standard timelines for your regular work, try to maintain those timelines here as well.
* If you have a revision or feedback process, try to keep that same kind of communication with the donor.
* The end result of the formless commission should be comparable to your regular commissions.

If being responsible for coming up with an idea for the formless commission is too much additional work, feel free to repurpose the donation as a gifted commission to another one of your fans who already has their own idea.

## How to Use This Document

If a donor would like to request a formless commission, they should contact you through your recommended/advertised channels.
Then the donor should ask, with a link to this document, if you would be willing to take on a formless commission.

## Why This Document

I like the vision of a [gift economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_economy), despite how implausible its existence might be.
I want to commission artists and participate in that process.
But I don't want to force myself to come up with an idea that is likely to be subpar and uninspired.
I already enjoy the work artists do outside of their regular commissions, so why not just pay for one of those.
