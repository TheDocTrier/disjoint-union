I am many things (see [links below](#links)).
More officially: I am a [mathematician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics).
Less officially: I am a programmer, a [humanist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanism), a historian, a [furry](https://en.wikifur.com/wiki/Furry), and possibly an artist (if I can find the motivation).

Here is some common information that you'll probably see in multiple places on the Internet:

* The website you are currently on, [Disjoint Union](https://disjointunion.link), is my personal (and official) writing depository.
* My name is *Michael Bradley* and I live in the [Pacific Time Zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Time_Zone).
* My web handle is typically `TheDocTrier` (post 2020, pronounced *try-ur*), however you may also see my decommissioned handle `Tankobot` (pre 2020).
* My [current profile picture](/pfp.png) is the first 256 rows of [Pascal's triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle) mod 6.
  * I chose it because while clearly not the [Sierpiński triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpiński_triangle), it still bears a peculiar similarity (the Sierpiński triangle can be gotten by using a modulus of 2 instead of 6).
  * Indeed, Pascal's mod 6 is the intersection of [Pascal's mod 2](/images/pascal/mod2.png) (the Sierpiński) and [Pascal's mod 3](/images/pascal/mod3.png).

## Advocacy

I am a passionate supporter of the [American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)](https://www.aclu.org), the [Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)](https://www.eff.org), and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://www.fsf.org).

# Links

Here are a bunch of links to my primary accounts across many services (ordered alphabetically).
Note that I barely access most of these accounts.
If you want to contact me, I currently recommend my [**Twitter**][twitter] or my [Telegram][telegram]<sup>[NOT SECURE](https://security.stackexchange.com/a/49802/240649)</sup>, where it's easiest for me to respond quickly.
I considered offering email, but it attracts too much abuse (mostly spam).
If you want a more secure option, and we're already [mutuals][mutual], then contact me via [Signal][signal].
The table given here is supposed to act as more of a *reference* for others (and myself).
Be warned, there may be mature materials behind any of the links given.
