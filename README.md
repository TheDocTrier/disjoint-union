# Disjoint Union

The live website can be found at https://disjointunion.link.
This repository constitutes both the complete history and current development of the website.

## Building the Website

Building this website requires [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
Other than installing Hugo, the setup process is simple (on [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux)).

```bash
# to build the website into docs/
make

# to serve the website locally with live updates
make serve

# to clear out the build artifacts
make clean
```

And that's it!

## Contributing

I like to believe that the Internet is a place for radical collaboration.
Thus I would love you help in improving my website.

### What should you feel free to fix yourself?

* Typos and Other Language Errors
  * I generally write in [American English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English) (being an American, it's no surprise).
  * I prefer clarity over formality (despite being a mathematician).
* Technical Bugs
* Broken Citations

I am more than happy to have a *grammar nazi* proofread my work.

**Never commit files in the `docs/` directory!**
I will always build the website myself when committing to the repository.

### What should you file as an issue so I can fix it?

* Factual Inaccuracies
* New Information Available

These problems require greater care to remedy.
Additionally, they may depend heavily on my subjective opinions.
