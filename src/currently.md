This page is my way of publicizing what projects are (or should) be receiving my attention.
Like many other people on the Internet, I don't have a strict schedule for most of these.
I try to provide an interval of time for each project during which you can expect an update.

I created this page to keep myself accountable (to my goals).
I may regret saying this... but, suppose you are a fan of one of my projects.
And, suppose I am more than two updates behind on that project according to this page.
Then, I give you permission to send me a message or two via my preferred channels listed [here](/#links).
If I see your message, I will try to either hasten my progress on the project or update this page with a fitting schedule.

## Disjoint Union

As mentioned on the [homepage](/), this website is my personal depository.
It primarily contains [essays](/essays/) and [art](/art/).
My current goal: at least one essay and piece of art per week.

The [life](/life/) section has no schedule.

## Pluvia

My current goal: at least one Pluvial piece per week.
