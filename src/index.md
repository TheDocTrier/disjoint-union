# Who is <span class="p-name italic whitespace-pre">Michael Bradley</span>

<div class="p-note">

More officially: I am a <a class="p-role" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics">mathematician</a>&nbsp;:mage: and a <a class="p-role" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_engineering">systems engineer</a>&nbsp;:wrench: in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace_manufacturer">aerospace industry</a>&nbsp;:airplane:.
Less officially: I am a [programmer]({{ my.github }})&nbsp;:computer:, a [secular humanist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secular_humanism)&nbsp;:people_hugging:, an [essayist](/essays/)&nbsp;:pen:, a [furry](/glossary/#furry)&nbsp;:raccoon:, and perhaps an [artist](/art/)&nbsp;:black_nib:&nbsp;:art: too.

Here is some common information that you'll probably see in multiple places on the Internet:

* The website you are currently on, <a class="u-url whitespace-pre" rel="me" href="https://brooksb.dev">Disjoint Union</a>&nbsp;:disjoint_union:, is my personal (and official) creative depository.
* I live in the <a class="p-tz" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones">America/Los_Angeles</a>&nbsp;:clock7: time zone.
* My full name is <span class="p-given-name">Michael</span> <span class="p-additional-name italic">Brooks</span> <span class="p-family-name">Bradley</span>, hence my email address <code><a class="u-email" rel="me" href="mailto:michael@brooksb.dev">michael@brooksb.dev</a></code>.
* My web handle is typically <code><span class="p-nickname">TheDocTrier</span></code>&nbsp;:label: (post 2020, a la *trier of fact*), however you may also see my decommissioned handle `Tankobot` (pre 2020).
* My <a class="u-photo" href="{{ '/pfp.png' | static }}">current profile picture</a>&nbsp;:framed_picture: is the first 256 rows of [Pascal's triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle) mod 6.
  * I chose it because, while clearly not the [Sierpiński triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpiński_triangle), it still bears a peculiar similarity (the Sierpiński triangle can be gotten by using a modulus of 2 instead of 6).
  * Indeed, Pascal's mod 6 is the intersection of [Pascal's mod 2]({{"/pascal/mod2.png"|static}}) (the Sierpiński) and [Pascal's mod 3]({{"/pascal/mod3.png"|static}}).

## Advocacy

Generally speaking, I am a supporter of

* the [American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)](https://www.aclu.org),
  * **for supporting the rights of** those with disabilities, people with HIV, immigrants, juveniles, people of all races, members of the LGBTQ community, the incarcerated, and women,

* [Wikipedia: The Free Encyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia),
  * for providing the largest encyclopedia of [free content](https://freedomdefined.org/Definition) managed through the open collaboration of volunteers,

## Links

Here are a bunch of links to my primary accounts across many services (ordered alphabetically).
Note that I barely access most of these accounts.
**Critically, you should only assume I had control over an account if it is listed here explicitly.**
However, this does not imply that I still control the account as security breaches are always a possibility.
If you want to contact me, I currently recommend my [**Twitter**]({{ my.twitter }}) or my [Telegram]({{ my.telegram }})<sup>[NOT SECURE](https://security.stackexchange.com/a/49802/240649)</sup>, where it's easiest for me to respond quickly.
You can also try sending an email to <code>[michael@brooksb.dev](mailto:michael@brooksb.dev)</code>, but spam may prevent me from seeing it.
If you want a more secure option, and we're already [mutuals][mutual], then contact me via [Signal][signal].
The table given here is supposed to act as more of a *reference* for others (and myself).
Be warned, there may be mature materials behind any of the links given.
