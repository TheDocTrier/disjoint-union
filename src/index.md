# Who is <span class="p-name italic whitespace-pre">Michael Bradley</span>

I am many things (see the [links below](#links)).
More officially: I am a <a class="p-role" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics">mathematician</a>&nbsp;:mage:.
Less officially: I am a programmer&nbsp;:computer:, a [secular humanist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secular_humanism)&nbsp;:people_hugging:, an [essayist](/essays/)&nbsp;:pen:, a [furry](https://en.wikifur.com/wiki/Furry)&nbsp;:raccoon:, and perhaps an [artist](/art/)&nbsp;:black_nib:&nbsp;:art: too.

Here is some common information that you'll probably see in multiple places on the Internet:

* The website you are currently on, <a class="u-url whitespace-pre" rel="me" href="https://www.disjointunion.link/">Disjoint Union</a>&nbsp;:disjoint_union:, is my personal (and official) creative depository.
* I live in the <a class="p-tz" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones">America/Los_Angeles</a>&nbsp;:clock7: time zone.
* My web handle is typically <code><span class="p-nickname">TheDocTrier</span></code>&nbsp;:label: (post 2020, pronounced <span class="whitespace-pre">try-er</span>), however you may also see my decommissioned handle `Tankobot` (pre 2020).
* My <a class="u-photo" href="{{ "/pfp.png" | static }}">current profile picture</a>&nbsp;:framed_picture: is the first 256 rows of [Pascal's triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle) mod 6.
  * I chose it because, while clearly not the [Sierpiński triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpiński_triangle), it still bears a peculiar similarity (the Sierpiński triangle can be gotten by using a modulus of 2 instead of 6).
  * Indeed, Pascal's mod 6 is the intersection of [Pascal's mod 2]({{ "/pascal/mod2.png" | static }}) (the Sierpiński) and [Pascal's mod 3]({{ "/pascal/mod3.png" | static }}).

## Advocacy

Generally speaking, I am a supporter of

* the [American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)](https://www.aclu.org),
  * **for supporting the rights of** those with disabilities, people with HIV, immigrants, juveniles, people of all races, members of the LGBTQ community, the incarcerated, and women,
  * **and for protecting** freedom of speech, human privacy, religious liberty, reproductive freedom, and voting rights,
* the [Comic Book Legal Defense Fund (CBLDF)](http://cbldf.org),
  * for defending freedom of speech and combating censorship,
  * see the article [*Why Defend Freedom of Icky Speech*](https://journal.neilgaiman.com/2008/12/why-defend-freedom-of-icky-speech.html) by Neil Gaiman, writer of *Coraline*, *American Gods*, and *Good Omens*, who is also an avid supporter of the CBLDF,
* [Wikipedia: The Free Encyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia),
  * for providing the largest encyclopedia of [free content](https://freedomdefined.org/Definition) managed through the open collaboration of volunteers,
* the [Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)](https://www.eff.org),
  * for promoting freedom of speech, human privacy, network neutrality, and procedural transparency,
  * and for criticizing digital rights management (DRM) and government surveillance,

## Links

Here are a bunch of links to my primary accounts across many services (ordered alphabetically).
Note that I barely access most of these accounts.
If you want to contact me, I currently recommend my [**Twitter**]({{ my.twitter }}) or my [Telegram]({{ my.telegram }})<sup>[NOT SECURE](https://security.stackexchange.com/a/49802/240649)</sup>, where it's easiest for me to respond quickly.
You can also try sending an email to <code><a class="u-email" rel="me" href="mailto:thedoctrier@gmail.com">thedoctrier@gmail.com</a></code>, but spam may prevent me from seeing it.
If you want a more secure option, and we're already [mutuals][mutual], then contact me via [Signal][signal].
The table given here is supposed to act as more of a *reference* for others (and myself).
Be warned, there may be mature materials behind any of the links given.
