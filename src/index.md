# Who is <span class="p-name italic whitespace-pre">Michael Bradley</span>

I am many things (see the [links below](#links)).
More officially: I am a <a class="p-role" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics">mathematician</a> :mage:.
Less officially: I am a programmer :computer:, a [secular humanist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secular_humanism) :people_hugging:, an [essayist](/essays/) :pen:, a [furry](https://en.wikifur.com/wiki/Furry) :raccoon:, and possibly a [creative](/art/) :black_nib: :art: (if I can find the motivation).

Here is some common information that you'll probably see in multiple places on the Internet:

* The website you are currently on, <a class="u-url whitespace-pre" rel="me" href="https://www.disjointunion.link/">Disjoint Union</a> :disjoint_union:, is my personal (and official) creative depository.
* I live in the <a class="p-tz" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Time_Zone">Pacific Time Zone</a> :clock7:.
* My web handle is typically <code><span class="p-nickname">TheDocTrier</span></code> :label: (post 2020, pronounced <span class="whitespace-pre">try-er</span>), however you may also see my decommissioned handle `Tankobot` (pre 2020).
* My <a class="u-photo" href="/static/pfp.png">current profile picture</a> :framed_picture: is the first 256 rows of [Pascal's triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle) mod 6.
  * I chose it because, while clearly not the [Sierpiński triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpiński_triangle), it still bears a peculiar similarity (the Sierpiński triangle can be gotten by using a modulus of 2 instead of 6).
  * Indeed, Pascal's mod 6 is the intersection of [Pascal's mod 2](/static/pascal/mod2.png) (the Sierpiński) and [Pascal's mod 3](/static/pascal/mod3.png).

## Advocacy

I am a passionate supporter of the [American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)](https://www.aclu.org), the [Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)](https://www.eff.org), and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://www.fsf.org).

## Links

Here are a bunch of links to my primary accounts across many services (ordered alphabetically).
Note that I barely access most of these accounts.
If you want to contact me, I currently recommend my [**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/TheDocTrier) or my [Telegram][telegram]<sup>[NOT SECURE](https://security.stackexchange.com/a/49802/240649)</sup>, where it's easiest for me to respond quickly.
You can also try sending an email to <code><a class="u-email" rel="me" href="mailto:thedoctrier@gmail.com">thedoctrier@gmail.com</a></code>, but spam may prevent me from seeing it.
If you want a more secure option, and we're already [mutuals][mutual], then contact me via [Signal][signal].
The table given here is supposed to act as more of a *reference* for others (and myself).
Be warned, there may be mature materials behind any of the links given.
