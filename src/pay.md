I want my work to contribute towards [cultural freedom](https://freedomdefined.org/Definition):

1. the **freedom to use** my work and enjoy the benefits of using it
2. the **freedom to study** my work and to apply knowledge acquired from it
3. the **freedom to make and redistribute copies**, in whole or in part, of the information or expression
4. the **freedom to make changes and improvements**, and to distribute derivative work

Pursuit of this goal entails some consequences:

* (1) and (3) imply **people will not be forced to pay** for my work.
* (2) and (4) imply **people can express themselves** with my work.

However, in our present society, money is expected.
Since I am unwilling to force payment, **I ask for it**.
If money is tight right now, I understand.
Consider how much money *your enjoyment of my work* is worth.
Can you spare that money?
How about a fraction of it?

Generally speaking, there are two types of monetary support you can provide: [recurring](#recurring) or [one-time](#one-time).

## Recurring

Recurring payments are **extremely helpful**.
They provide a significantly greater amount of stability for myself and my work compared to one-time payments.
Look at my [currently](/currently/) page.
See if a subset of my work warrants your recurring support.
If it does, go to one of my recurring payment portals (linked below) and help me continue that work.
In your payment, make sure to mention what work you appreciate most.
I can't guarantee that I will continue that particular work, but I will definitely factor it into my goals.

For recurring support, you can use my [Patreon]({{ my.patreon }}) (preferred) or my [Ko-fi]({{ my.kofi }}).

If for whatever reason, you would rather make **anonymous** donations, or extremely **small donations**, you can use my [Liberapay]({{ my.liberapay }}).

## One-time

Sometimes, recurring payments aren't the most practical option.
One-time payments may be used instead.
If you want to show support for a *one-off* work, a *one-time* payment is appreciated.

For one-time support, you can use my [Ko-fi]({{ my.kofi }}).
